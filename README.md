### Here's My Non-Linear Path to ML ðŸ‘£

My name is Jimmy Wong, an enthusiast in neuroscience ðŸ§  &nbsp;and ML ðŸ¤– . Iâ€™m a Recent Graduate in Biomedical Engineering (MASc) from the University of Toronto. Before my journey into engineering, I completed an Hons. BSc degree in Neuroscience and Psychology at U of T. 

I fell in love with Engineering and Data Science when I first came across them in my fourth year. Since then, I began my journey into programming and ML. I have worked at major hospitals in Toronto for almost 4 years and been applying my knowledge in neuroscience, ML, and statistics to process and analyze large neuroimaging datasets (MRI, MEG). I enjoy learning and resolving new problems ðŸ§© . 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Neuroscience, ML, Deep Learning, and Bioinformatics.
