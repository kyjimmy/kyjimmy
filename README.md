### Here's My Non-Linear Path to Data Science and Machine Learning ðŸ‘£

My name is Jimmy Wong, a professional in neuroscience ðŸ§  &nbsp;and Machine Learning (ML) ðŸ¤– . Iâ€™m currently a Research Methods Specialist at CAMH after obtaining a Master degree in Biomedical Engineering (MASc) from the University of Toronto (UofT). Before my journey into ML and engineering, I completed an Hons. BSc degree in Neuroscience and Psychology at UofT. 

I discovered my passion for Data Science and ML during my fourth year, when I had the opportunity to work in a neuroimaging lab. This experience opened up the world of engineering, image processing, and data analytics to me, igniting my passion for programming and ML. Over the past five years, I have worked at leading hospitals in Toronto and been applying my knowledge in neuroscience, signal processing, ML, and statistics to process and analyze large multimodal and neuroimaging (MRI, EEG, MEG) datasets. I enjoy learning and resolving new problems ðŸ§© . 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Neuroscience, ML, Deep Learning, and Bioinformatics.
