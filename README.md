### Here's My Non-Linear Path to ML 👣

My name is Jimmy Wong, an enthusiast in neuroscience 🧠 &nbsp;and ML 🤖 . I’m currently a Research Analyst at CAMH after obtaining a master degree in Biomedical Engineering (MASc) from the University of Toronto. Before my journey into engineering, I completed an Hons. BSc degree in Neuroscience and Psychology at U of T. 

I fell in love with Engineering and Data Science when I first came across them in my fourth year. Since then, I began my journey into programming and ML. I have worked at major hospitals in Toronto for more than 4 years and been applying my knowledge in neuroscience, ML, and statistics to process and analyze large neuroimaging datasets (MRI, MEG). I enjoy learning and resolving new problems 🧩 .
